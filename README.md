Scripts and settings for home automation

Not much more to say, I am currently on the adventure of making my home smarter. This is mostly a collection of scripts so I don't forget what to do next time.

Personally I'm using a RPi3 as a gateway to call the scripts from iOS's Shortcut app for Siri integration. That way I only have to manage SSH keys from the iDevices on the gateway.
